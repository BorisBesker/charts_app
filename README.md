# charts_app


An application for creating and displaying charts based on imported data.

Users:
Admin
User

Use cases:
Admin has CRUD privileges on users and other models
User can either import a document with the data of a graph or enter it manually
User can pick and choose for at least 4 different graph types
User can export the data (mostly because of the manually entered data) to CSV or JSON
User can save his graphs and revisit them later
User can export data in XLS(X)


Implications
The application should be done in the MVC architecture
An authentication system should be implemented
